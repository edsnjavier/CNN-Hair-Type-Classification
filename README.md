# Hair Type Classification using CNN

## Description
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with Keras and TensorFlow to classify different hair types. The model is trained to recognize and categorize hair textures based on given image datasets, enabling automated hair type identification for various applications.

## Dataset
The dataset was provided to us and contains images representing different hair types.

## Features
- Data exploration and analysis
- Model development using CNN
- Prediction and evaluation

## Repository Overview
This repository includes:
- A PDF file summarizing the write-up for this project
- Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) with different model versions for experimentation
